# 🏞️ Territory Analysis – Programming Fundamentals Project

**Grade:** 18.25 / 20  
**Project Type:** SOLO Project  
**Course:** Programming Fundamentals (Project 1)

## 📘 Overview

In this first Programming Fundamentals project, you'll develop functions to analyze a **rectangular territory** composed of **intersecting paths**. The terrain may also contain natural features such as:

- 🏔️ **Mountains** (forming ranges)
- ⛰️ **Valleys**

Your task is to interpret and compute properties of these geographical features using logic and code.

## 💡 Goals

- Practice function writing and modular programming
- Understand how to represent and analyze 2D data
- Work with conditions, loops, and arrays effectively

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Language: `Python`
- Tools: Any IDE or code editor

## ✅ Evaluation

- Total Points: **20**
- Score Achieved: **18.25**
- Criteria: Code correctness, clarity, structure, and use of programming concepts
