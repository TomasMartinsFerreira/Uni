# ⛺ Tent Puzzle Solver – Logic for Programming 

**Grade:** 19.6 / 20  
**Project Type:** SOLO Project  
**Course:** Logic for Programming

## 📘 Overview

This project involves building a solver for the **Tent Puzzle** game — a logical puzzle where players must place tents next to trees according to specific rules.

### 🧩 Puzzle Mechanics

The idea is to:

1. **Iteratively place tents** on all possible valid spots
2. **Backtrack** and redo placements until a valid full-board solution is found
3. Ensure compliance with puzzle constraints at every step

## 💡 Key Concepts

- Recursive backtracking
- Logical validation of board states
- Systematic search of solution space

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: `Prolog`

## ✅ Evaluation

- Total Points: **20**
- Score Achieved: **19.6**
- Assessed on: Problem-solving strategy, code clarity, recursion usage, and correctness
