# 🧮 K-Means Clustering in RISC-V Assembly - Introduction to Computer Architecture

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements the **k-means clustering algorithm** in RISC-V assembly language. The goal is to group a set of 2D points into `k` clusters based on their proximity to each other.

## ✨ Key Features
- ⚡ Implements the standard k-means algorithm
- 📊 Works with 2D coordinate data
- 💻 Written in efficient RISC-V assembly
- 🏆 Achieved a grade of **19.15/20** (Group Project)

## 📚 Algorithm Description
K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that:
1. 🎯 Randomly initializes `k` cluster centers
2. 📌 Assigns each point to the nearest center
3. 🔄 Recalculates center positions based on assigned points
4. 🔁 Repeats until convergence
