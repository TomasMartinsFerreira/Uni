# 🗃️⚡IST-KVS: Key-Value Store Project - Operating Systems

## Overview  
**IST-KVS** is a high-performance **key-value store written in C**, leveraging:  
- **Parallel tasks** 🚀 for blazing-fast requests.  
- **Non-blocking backups** ⏳ using processes.  
- **IPC (FIFOs & signals)** 📨 for cross-process communication.  
- **POSIX file APIs** 💾 for durable storage.  

## Grades 📊  (GROUP PROJECT)
- **Part 1:** `17.71 / 20`  
- **Part 2:** `18.43 / 20` 
- **Final:**  `18.07 / 20`  

## Key Features ✨  
✔ **Pure C implementation** 🖥️  
✔ Scalable synchronization (mutexes/atomics)  
✔ FIFO & signal-based IPC  
✔ Crash-resistant file I/O  

## Learning Outcomes 🎯  
- **Systems programming in C**  
- Parallelism & process management  
- POSIX files, pipes, and signals  
- Building a **production-grade KVS** from scratch!
